# VisualMath
A python library to visualize mathematics (e.g. prime numbers)
https://pypi.org/manage/project/VisualMathematics/release/0.2/

Project VisualMath aims to show students all over the world how fascinating mathematics is. To make this possible, a python library is developed here, which should make it possible for everyone to discover the beauty of mathematics. This project has just started and I am excited to see where it goes. 
I would be happy if more passionate developers would help to drive this project forward.
